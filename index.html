<p id="moreInfo" class="moreInfo">The Steam Center is Allen ISD’s haven for the thinkers of all ages. In this building, you can find resources for science, technology, arts, and mathematics. For high schoolers, the steam center contains a multitude of classrooms and science labs, along with collaborative spaces. Younger students in the elementary and middle school experience the steam center through interactive field trips which include activities and presentations to help stimulate problem-solving skills.

<p id="moreInfo2" class="moreInfo">Split down the middle to minimize contact, the large main hallways are lined with stations containing charging outlets, chairs, and tables, used from eating lunch to doing homework. These walkways branch off into collaborative spaces and huddle rooms, giving the students the space to work.

<p id="moreInfo6" class="moreInfo">The flight is one of the main features of the STEAM center. Its steps double as seats that can be used for presentations. When presenting, the presenter has access to a large whiteboard (which doubles as an opening to the multi-purpose room) as well as one massive screen assembled from four large TV screens. The flight steps also include outlets, allowing students to sit and charge their devices during their privilege period.
